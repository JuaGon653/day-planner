# work-day-scheduler

## Description

For challenge 5 of the coding bootcamp, I was asked to create a standard hour work day scheduler. When the page is opened they also wanted the current day to be presented in the header of the page. The time blocks (9am-5pm) are then checked to see if that time is in the future, past, or present. Which is represented by the color of the time block. Lastly, in order to save the event(s) after you refresh or exit the window, you have to press the save button in the corresponding row that the event you want to save is in. Lastly, if there are still events in the local storage after it is the next day, the saved events are then deleted and you are given the application with no saved events.
